# **Dating App**

Please find a demo implementation of the Tinder like swipe to select/reject feature in iOS 10 using Swift 3.1, [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and the [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) Application architecture. 

In the interest of time the app also uses the [MDCSwipeToChoose](https://github.com/modocache/MDCSwipeToChoose) library.

To run the app in your enviroment please intstall [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) and then run - `pod install --repo-update`

For unit test we have used iOS' inbuilt *XCTest* library including its Asynchronous test support libraries.
